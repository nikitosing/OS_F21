The crucial difference between physical and virtual addresses is that any physical address is stands for the real place at the main memory, but for the virtual address it isn't so. As virtual address could be mapped to the main memory at the neccesary period of time. There are no need and possibility to hold all the virtual addresses at the main memory. And also as the rule virtual addresses much more than available place at the main memory.
